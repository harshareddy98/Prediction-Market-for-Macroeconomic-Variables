Put bad data in, get bad data out: The power of machine learning depends on the data it is fed.

Modern AI and machine learning solutions may be incredibly powerful and sophisticated, but without data, they are absolutely useless. It's like blood to the human body. The performance of AI and machine learning will be equally defective and subpar if data is bad—incomplete, corrupted, wrong, prejudiced, etc.—just like blood in the human body. Therefore, if we want to adopt cutting-edge technologies, we must start with the appropriate fundamentals.


So, more time can invested to research in how should we give relevant input to machine learning models.
