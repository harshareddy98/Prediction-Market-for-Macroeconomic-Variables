S.No & Model & Testing RMSE\\
\hline
 1. & Exponential Smoothing & 2.1616 \\
 2. & Auto-Regressive Moving Average & 1.9255 \\ 
 3. & Vector Auto-Regressive & 1.3339 \\ 
 4. & LSTM Model & 0.089 \\

Observation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In uni-variate model when we used only inflation data for prediction ARMA had better performance than Exponential Smoothing.
    \item In multivariate model considering other feature into consideration LSTM had performed better than VAR as well as other uni-variate model.
    \item In time series for-casting also we can't be dependent only single input we need to go with multivariate forecasting for better results considering relevant other features with target variable.
\end{itemize}
