\chapter*{Abstract}

The central bank and other government agencies may be better able to utilise monetary policy to stabilise prices and prevent the impact of inflation on market entities with the use of forward-looking inflation forecasts, especially for low- and middle-income groups. Additionally, it can assist investors and financial organisations in making smarter investment choices. In this regard, the inflation rate forecast is very important.

This literature mainly uses three different univariate  and multivariate linear models such as Exponential Smoothing, autoregressiveâ€“moving-average (ARMA)  and vector autoregressive (VAR)  models along with one non-linear LSTM model to predict the inflation rate of UK and compare the results of all different models.
