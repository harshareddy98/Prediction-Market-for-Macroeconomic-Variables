# Prediction-Market-for-Macroeconomic-Variables
Project summary:
-Inflation Prediction From the year 2022 by considering the data from 1960 till 2021
-Testing Univariate model against multivariate model analysis to see which one gives apt or accurate prediction.
-Using reccurent neural networks that is using the output from previous phase onto the next to ease up the analysis
-Prediction results: ARMA,Exponential smoothing, Vector auto regression, LSTM Models
